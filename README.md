###### My Favourite place in the world is Ladakh located in India.
The best time to visit Ladakh is summer, I mostly like the **Adventurous Road-trip** on Bikes there in the snow and in between the mountains.Second comes the **Camping** and **Trekking** which are very famous and offers a plenty of plans like mountaineering,jeep safari,Hemis National Park. <br> The another important thing is **Magnetic Hill** which is famous for its scenic views and rough terrain,it is also known as Phenomenal Magnetic Hill- if we leave the vechile at hill's base and keep the brakes unlocked,slowly the vechile moves uphill without any support!<br> Apart from these I also love the White Water Rafting which is also named as **Grand Canyon of India**.
